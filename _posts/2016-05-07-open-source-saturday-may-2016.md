At Red Panthers, we are hosting Open Source Saturday on the 7th May, 2016. The idea is to spend the entire day contributing & discussing about open source projects. The food, drinks & swags are on us. Since we will be arranging for the food (including lunch) and drinks, we require you to RSVP for the event, by dropping an email to me directly.

Agenda
--------

* 10:00 AM - General introduction
* 10:30 AM - Group up as pairs and start selecting the issues/projects you are interested
* 10:31 AM - Start Coding :)
* 12:30 PM - Break for Lunch and Socialize, discuss the issues/challenges you are facing while coding
* 02:00 PM - Resume Coding
* 05:00 PM - Finish for the day, share your experience. If interested can continue coding, and finish what was started.

After 05:00 the event doesn't have to stop here, we can continue our discussions at a local coffee shop or Beer Palour (Have KRUG's first DrinkUp :D )
