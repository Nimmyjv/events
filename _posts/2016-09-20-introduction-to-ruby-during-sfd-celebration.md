As a part of the Software Freedom Day celebrations organized by UC college Aluwye & FOSS Club Kerala, our CEO was invited to give an introduction to Ruby Programing Language. During the talk, he shared with the students the philosophy behind Ruby, which he referred to as Rubyness, and why it became so popular. The talk was well received and was attended by around 200 students.
